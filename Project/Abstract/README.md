####*The main aim of this circuit is to take the attendance and display when requested ####

This paper is presented about a system of recording student attendance using fingerprint identification that allows students to monitor student attendance to class is a true electronically. It can reduce the presence of fraudulent students who are now mostly done by the students and the system can also reduce problems such as the presence of the missing paper and easily damaged. With this system can replace the existing manual system to a more systematic and electronics. This attendance system will be displayed on a computer lecturer with more attractive and graphics and have students complete detail using Microsoft Visual Basic Studio and integrated using the Fingerprint Reader.


1)Finger print identification is based on the fact that no two persons will have the same finger print in this world. 

2)This is because of the peculiar genetic code of DNA in each person. 

3)Finger print module differentiates between two fingers based on the ridges and valleys on finger print. 

4)Inside the finger print module a DSP processor is present to implement and analyze the algorithm.

5)Main heart of the circuit is finger print module. 

6)This sends commands to the controller when ever finger print is matched. 

7)Microcontroller receives these commands from the finger print module and uses the internal EEPROM to store the attendance. 
8
)Keypad is used to send the requests to the controller either enroll the new one or to save the attendance or to exit.


*LCD DISPLAY displays the messages related to the commands received*
