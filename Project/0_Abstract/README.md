## The main aim of this circuit is to main a constant temperature in the specified area

Abstract - In this project, we will build a small circuit to interface Arduino with DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor. One of the main applications of connecting DTH11 sensor with Arduino is weather monitoring.
Also we can connect this to a fan, A.c depends upon the user's usage.

###### I. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE
The aim of this system is to implement in C#.net set of reliable techniques for maintaining constant Temperature .

###### Problem statement

Nowadays Half-cooked food business is growing in a very large-scale. This industry will be run untill they achieve a constant temperature in their storage areas.
Here they need constant temperature. Fluctuation of temperature may cause a very big loss to these Industries.
For solving this problem we are here with the solution.
